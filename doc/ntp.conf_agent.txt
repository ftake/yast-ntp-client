ntp.conf agent
==============

ntp.conf file's interface is in ini-agent style. The only difference is
that keys can be present multiple times.  It means that instead of
single value, Read call returns list of values (and Write accepts
multiple values).

Important keys (that are to be read and written) are server, peer, fudge,
broadcast and broadcastclient. As these lines consist from

<key> <address> <options>

where key and address aren't allowed to contain blank space. Options
aren't parsed, and are kept as one string (this way NTP client component
can decide the way the user edits them).

Reading some key returns a list of all values whith this key. Each value
is a list, where first entry is the address, and the second entry
represents the options.

Value taken for writing has the same format.

As order of lines in /etc/ntp.conf is in most cases not important,
ntp.conf agent doesn't care about the order too much. The only case
when order is important is the "fudge" option, that should immediately
follow appropriate "server" option. When writing the "fudge" option,
ntp.conf agent makes sure that each "fudge" option follows appropriate
"server" option. Because of this writing "fudge" options must be
performed after writing "server" options (although "fidge" options
didn't change).


Agent interface:
----------------

Read (.etc.ntp_conf.server) -> [ ["chimera.suse.cz", ""], ["10.20.0.20", "" ]]
  reads all servers present in the configuration file
Write (.etc.ntp_conf.server, [ ["chimera.suse.cz", ""] ]) -> true
  writes list of servers to the configuration file
Write (.etc.ntp_conf, nil) -> true
  really saves the configuration file to the disk
Read (.etc.ntp_conf._reread) -> true
  forces rereading configuration file from the disk
Read (.etc.ntp_conf) -> [ ["server", "chimera", ""], ["peer", "pegasus", ""]]
  reads complete list of all records. Usable mainly for debugging
Write (.etc.ntp_conf, []) -> true
  writes complete list of all records. May be usable during
  autoinstallation to clean the file
Write (.etc.ntp_conf.settings.ntp_conf_filename, "/etc/ntp.conf")
  sets filename ntp agent will use. Is useful for creating testsuite
  for this agent.
